# Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

### Overview

This repository contains the implementation of Dynamic Network (DyNet), a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm designed to optimize bandwidth allocation in multi-agent systems. DyNet dynamically adjusts bandwidth usage based on each agent's needs using an Actor-Critic framework with Deep Q-Networks (DQN). A penalty term is incorporated into the objective function to encourage efficient communication, allowing agents to transmit messages only when necessary. The algorithm has been validated in vehicular networks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.
